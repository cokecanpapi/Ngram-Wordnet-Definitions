# Ngram-Wordnet-Definitions
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to extract definitions from WordNet for n-grams (sequences of n words) found in a given text. It uses the NLTK library to tokenize the text, extract n-grams, and retrieve definitions from WordNet for each n-gram.
